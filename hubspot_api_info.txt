Yes, exactly! You'll need to do it in two steps:

1. **Create the contact first:**
   `POST /crm/v3/objects/contacts`

2. **Then create the lead and associate it with that contact:**
   `POST /crm/v3/objects/leads`
   You'll need to include an association to the contact you just created.

The leads API requires the contact association, so the order matters — contact first, then lead.

Here's your summary for the Meetings Scheduling API:

Prerequisites
You need a scheduling page set up in HubSpot with a connected calendar.
Required scope: scheduler.meetings.meeting-link.read (for reading), plus write scopes for booking.
Endpoints
1. List scheduling pages
GET /scheduler/v3/meetings/meeting-links
Returns all your meeting links (slug, name, type, organizer, etc.)
2. Get booking info & availability
GET /scheduler/v3/meetings/meeting-links/book/{slug}
Query params: timezone (e.g., America/New_York), monthOffset (0 = current month)
Returns: busy times, availability windows per duration, form fields, buffer time, guest settings, branding metadata
3. Get next availability page (pagination)
GET /scheduler/v3/meetings/meeting-links/book/availability-page/{slug}
Query param: timezone
Returns: additional availability slots, hasMore flag for further pagination
4. Book a meeting
POST /scheduler/v3/meetings/meeting-links/book?timezone=America/New_York
Request body:
{
  "slug": "jdoe",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "startTime": 1726059600000,
  "duration": 1800000,
  "guestEmails": [],
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "locale": "en-us",
  "likelyAvailableUserIds": []
}
Automatically creates/matches a contact — returns contactId in the response.
Response includes: calendarEventId, start, end, duration, contactId, isOffline
Key notes
If the calendar can't be reached, the meeting books offline (isOffline: true) — no calendar event is created, but the user gets notified.
Not supported: UTM/UTK tracking, rescheduling, CAPTCHA tokens, payment meetings, or IP address submission.
The slug is typically the first initial + last name (e.g., jdoe for John Doe).
Availability times are in milliseconds UTC.
